# Persoanl Website

## Where I Can I See This Site?
Wonderful question! With the help of GitHub Pages (feel free to make your own website as well: https://pages.github.com), I was able to deploy this site with a domain provided by the repository I created for this project. The link is here:  https://kevin-rodri.github.io/ .  

## I Don't Like Your Website.. 
Feel free to contact me through the contact information I provied on my site. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! 


## Credits
While this website was designed on my own, I want to highlight some sources used: https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp for if you want to use emjoi's

I have added Bootstrap to my website. If that is something you're willing to explore, here you go: https://getbootstrap.com

You might notice (or not), but my original site was made completely using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while using bootstrap (still used). This was redevloped using Vite: https://vitejs.dev
